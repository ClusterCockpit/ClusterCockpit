                <h2>General information on data processing</h2>

                <h3>Scope of processing of personal data</h3>
                <p>
                    We only process our users’ personal data to the extent necessary to provide services,     content and a functional website. As a rule, personal data are only processed after      the user gives their consent. An exception applies in those cases where it is      impractical to obtain the user’s prior consent and the processing of such data is      permitted by law.
                </p>

                <h3>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h3>
                <p>
                    Art. 6 (1) (a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forms
                    the legal     basis for us to obtain the consent of a data subject for
                    their personal data to be      processed.<br> When processing personal data
                    required for the performance of a contract in which the  contractual party is
                    the data subject, Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR forms the legal basis. This  also applies
                    if data has to be processed in order to carry out pre-contractual
                    activities.<br> Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR forms the legal basis if personal data has
                    to be processed in order  to fulfil a legal obligation on the part of our
                    organisation.<br> Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR forms the legal basis in the case that
                    vital interests of the data  subject or another natural person make the
                    processing of personal data necessary.<br> If data processing is necessary in
                    order to protect the legitimate interests of our  organisation or of a third
                    party and if the interests, basic rights and fundamental  freedoms of the data
                    subject do not outweigh the interests mentioned above,  Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR
                    forms the legal basis for such data processing.
                </p>

                <h3>Deletion of data and storage period</h3>

                <p>The personal data of the data
                    subject are deleted or blocked as soon as the reason      for storing them
                    ceases to exist. Storage beyond this time period may occur if      provided
                    for by European or national legislators in directives under Union
                    legislation, laws or other regulations to which the data controller is
                    subject.      Such data are also blocked or deleted if a storage period
                    prescribed by one of the      above-named rules expires, unless further
                    storage of the data is necessary for      entering into or performing a
                    contract.

                <h2>Provision of the website and generation of log files</h2>
                <h3>Description and scope of data processing</h3>
                <p>
                    Each time our website is accessed, our system
                    automatically collects data and      information from
                    the user’s computer system.<br> In this context, the
                    following data are collected:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Address (URL) of
                        the website from which the file was requested</li>
                    <li>Name of the retrieved file</li>
                    <li>Date and time of the request</li>
                    <li>Data volume transmitted</li>
                    <li>Access status (file transferred, file not found,
                        etc.)</li>
                    <li>Description of the type of web browser and/or operating system used</li>
                    <li>Anonymised IP address of the requesting computer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The data
                    stored are required exclusively for technical or statistical
                    purposes; no      comparison with other data or disclosure to third
                    parties occurs, not even in part.      The data are stored in our
                    system’s log files. This is not the case for the user’s      IP
                    addresses or other data that make it possible to assign the data to a
                    specific      user: before data are stored, each dataset is anonymised by
                    changing the IP address.      These data are not stored together with other
                    personal data .
                </p>

                <h3>Legal basis for data processing</h3>
                <p>
                    The legal basis
                    for the temporary storage of data and logfiles is §§ 14, 15 TMG,      § 100
                    Abs. 1 TKG and Art. 4 BayDSG following the tasks of Art. 11 BayEGovG and
                    Art. 7 and 34 BayHO
                </p>

                <h3>Purpose of data processing</h3>
                <p>The temporary
                    storage of the IP address by the system is necessary in order to      deliver
                    the website to the user’s computer. For this purpose, the user’s IP address
                    must remain stored for the duration of the session.<br> The storage of such
                    data in log files takes place in order to ensure the website’s  functionality.
                    These data also serve to help us optimise the website and ensure that our  IT
                    systems are secure. They are not evaluated for marketing purposes in this
                    respect.</p>

                <h3>Storage period</h3>
                <p> Data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for fulfilling the
                    purpose      for which they were collected. If data have been collected for
                    the purpose of      providing the website, they are deleted at the end of
                    the respective session.<br> If data are stored in log files, they are deleted
                    at the latest after seven days. A  longer storage period is possible. In this
                    case, the users’ IP addresses are deleted  or masked so that they can no longer
                    be assigned to the client accessing the website.
                </p>

                <h3>Options for filing an objection or requesting removal</h3>
                <p>
                    The collection of data for the purpose
                    of providing the website and the storage of     such data in log files is
                    essential to the website’s operation. As a consequence,      the user has no
                    possibility to object.

                <h2>Rights of the data subject</h2>
                <p>
                    With regard to the processing of your personal
                    data, you as a data subject are      entitled to the
                    following rights pursuant to Art. 15 et seq. GDPR:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You can request information as to whether we process your personal
                        data. If 	this is the case, you have the right to information about this
                        personal data 	as well as further information in connection with the
                        processing (Art. 15 GDPR).  	Please note that this right of access may
                        be restricted or excluded in certain  	cases (cf. in particular Art. 10
                        BayDSG).</li>
                    <li>In the event that personal data about you is (no
                        longer) accurate or incomplete,  	you may request that this data be
                        corrected and, if necessary, completed  	(Art. 16 GDPR).</li>
                    <li>If
                        the legal requirements are met, you can demand that your personal data be
                        erased  	(Art. 17 GDPR) or that the processing of this data be
                        restricted (Art. 18 DSGVO).  	However, the right to erasure pursuant to
                        Art. 17 (1) and (2) GDPR does not apply,  	inter alia, if the processing
                        of personal data is necessary for the performance 	of a task carried out
                        in the public interest or in the exercise of official  	authority or in the
                        exercise of official authority vested (Art. 17 para. 3 	letter b
                        GDPR).</li>
                    <li>If you have given your consent to the processing, you
                        have the right to 	withdrawal it at any time. The withdrawal will only
                        take effect in the future;  	this means that the withdrawal does not
                        affect the lawfulness of the processing  	operations carried out on the
                        basis of the consent up to the withdrawal.</li>
                    <li>For reasons arising

                        of your personal data by us at any time (Art. 21 GDPR). If the legal
                        requirements are met, we will subsequently no longer process your personal
                        data.</li>
                    <li>Insofar as you have consented to the processing of your
                        personal data or have  	agreed to the performance of the contract and the
                        data processing is carried  	out automated , you may be entitled to data
                        portability (Art. 20 GDPR).</li>
