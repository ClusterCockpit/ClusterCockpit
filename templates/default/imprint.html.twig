                        The operator has compiled and verified all information provided with great
                        care.  However, we cannot assume liability or furnish a guarantee that the

                    <p>
                        The operator expressly reserves the right to change, amend or delete
                        individual web  pages, services or the entire website without prior notice

                    <h2>Links and references (disclaimer)</h2>

                    <p>
                        The operator is only responsible for the original
                        content provided in accordance with      the applicable
                        laws. This original content is to be distinguished from links to the
                        websites of other operators. Through these references marked as ‘external
                        links’,      the operator enables visitors to access ‘third-party content’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The operator is not responsible for this
                        third-party content as the operator does not  initiate
                        the data transmission, does not choose the recipient of
                        the information and does  not select or have any influence on the information
                        transmitted. The methods used to provide access and link to this third-party
                        information also do not involve any automatic  short-term storage, resulting in
                        a full exclusion of any liability for third-party content  on the operator’s
                        part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When links to these websites were first incorporated, however,
                        the authors of the relevant  websites or the operator’s editors reviewed the
                        external content to ascertain whether it  would possibly entail liability under
                        civil or criminal law. Should the operator become  aware or be made aware by
                        others that the content of a website linked from this site could  constitute a
                        civil or criminal law violation, then the link will be immediately removed  as
                        long as this is technically feasible and within reasonable expectation.

                    <p>
                        Liability for illegal, inaccurate or incomplete content and for damages
                        resulting from  the use or non-use of information provided by third parties
                        shall lie exclusively with  the respective operators of the linked sites.
